            Welcome. This is a brief writeup on this year's Christmas game.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year's game is based on everyone's favourite game, <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> and 
            this family of Rhythm & Dance games. So how do you play?
        </p>
        <p>
            The game has certain number of <em>levels</em> that you have to clear to get the secret 
            message at the end that will help you locate the location where the forgotful Ježíšek misplaced
            your presents this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every level has one of the <em>modes</em>: <b>Whack-a-beat</b> or <b>Fiat lux</b>. All levels
            are cooperative, i.e. you don't compete with other players, but you work together to get the
            highest score and beat the level target.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every level has three phases:
            <ol>
                <li><em>Get ready</em> all players have to press Ready buttons on their controllers.
                When you do, watch the tree! It will highlight your position. You can press Start button 
                repeatedly</li>
                <li><em>Play</em> you play the level, depending on the mode -- see below.</li>
                <li><em>Score</em> your total score will be displayed with following simple rules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Red: 100s</li>
                        <li>Green: 1'000s</li>
                        <li>Blue: 10'000s</li>
                        <li>Yellow: 100'000s</li>
                        <li>White: 1'000'000s</li>
                    </ul>
                    when all players press Start on their controllers, the score will be dismissed and next
                    level will start.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="DDR">
        <p class="h">Whack-a-beat mode</p>
        <p>
            This mode is most similair to well known games like DDR or Guitar Hero: balls of colour race along
            the tree and you have to hit it when it reaches your position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every player has his or her own part of the chain, but all players get the same balls at the 
            same time, so you can advise each other. You cannot move, obviously, and it is important to
            pay attention while pressing the Start to begin the level to understand your position.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should hit a button just when the ball is passing through your position. Depending on how
            well you do that, the leds just behind your position will blink. These leds also show your streak
            if you have any -- you build streak by succesfully hitting the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
            The leds on the left (ball always travel from left to right, from the beginning of the chain 
            to the end, i.e. from the floor up) of your playing field show your score, but it will be probably
            difficult for you to watch it during play. Don't mind it and focus on whacking the beats!
        </p>
        <p>
            Important part of this game mode is scoring, what follows is verbatim copy of the code:
            <pre>
int M = (streak / 4) + 1;
int points_earned = 0;
int bullet_value = (int[]){ 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 } [hit_colour] ;
switch (hit)
{
case DHI_MISS:
    points_earned = -bullet_value / 10;
    break;
case DHI_GOOD:
    points_earned = M * bullet_value;
    break;
case DHI_GREAT:
    points_earned = M * M * bullet_value;
    break;
case DHI_PERFECT:
    points_earned = M * M * 3 * bullet_value;
    break;
case DHI_N_COUNT:
    break;
}
            </pre>
            You cannot be more explicit that that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="OSC">
        <p class="h">Fiat lux</p>
        <p>
            In this mode you try to light up the whole chain by hitting buttons to the beat. When you do, you 
            will highlight the leds immediately to the left and right of your position (and on your position 
            too), but when several players hit button simultaneously close to each other, more leds will
            be highlighted and they will even get more energy, so they won't fade out so soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this mode you can move and you can tell which position is you in two ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Watch the tree when pressing the Start button before the game begins</li>
                <li>Every position blinks briefly every three seconds, the number of blinks corresponds
                    to your player number</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The chain is evaluated every beat and we measure how many leds are in sync with the song, and in 
            the end we calculate your effectiveness and thence your score
        </p>

        <p class="h">Good luck!</p>
